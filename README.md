💡 **A bit about me**

I'm a detail-driven SDET with experience building robust automation frameworks for both **web and mobile applications**. My work focuses on ensuring reliability, scalability, and quality through automation.  
I enjoy transforming manual repetitive efforts into fully automated systems that integrate seamlessly into CI/CD pipelines — because quality shouldn’t slow delivery; it should strengthen it.

My background includes development as well, which helps me understand systems end-to-end and write automation that feels closer to engineering than just “testing scripts.”  
(And yes — my dev side still exists, quietly peeking from behind the curtains 👨‍💻✨.)
